## Andy Bell

Passionate software developer, with a preference towards new and exciting technologies and approaches.

Ideally looking for a junior back-end developer role, with a team that constantly looks forward at new developments in technology.


## Skills

#### Learning

Firstly, I love to learn new information, it is really what drives me. At Makers I have demonstrated this multiple times, firstly through the nature of the 
course (learning the principles of software development in just 12 weeks), and also through constantly pushing myself from my comfort zone - such as with our
final project; writing a search engine in a language I had not touched before the start of the two week project.

#### Mentoring

Through Makers, I have found that I really enjoy sharing information with my collegues, and assisting with issues they have encountered. I have found this
approach has helped further my understanding of the topics & technologies, as explaining often requires a more in-depth analysis of the "why" instead of just
the "how" something works.

#### Problem Solving

I enjoy solving problems.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (May-16 to August-16)

A 12 Week Software Development Bootcamp, aiming on teaching process and best practice over just flavour of the month techstacks. Focus on TDD, SOLID and clean code
with object orientated design (OOP) emphasised when using applicable languages.

Languages covered during course; Ruby (with Rails/ Sinatra frameworks), Javascript (vanilla, ES6, React and Node), Elixir (with Phoenix) and have taught myself in my
spare time Rust, Go and a small amount of Java. Alongside this, several testing frameworks have been used to ensure TDD is followed; RSpec and Minitest for Ruby, 
Jasmine and Mocha (with Chai assertion library) for Javascript, ExUnit and ESpec for Elixir, and Zombie, PhantomJS and Capybara for BDD testing of front-end functionality.
